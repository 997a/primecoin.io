                <div>
                    <img src="images/about1.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Sunny King, dedicated to Satoshi Nakamoto and all who have fought for the freedom of mankind, who invented Peercoin(PPC) and Primecoin(XPM) that have made significant contributions to cryptocurrency technology. Besides, he created Proof-of-Stake(PoS) to make the blockchain more energy efficient. Proof-of Stake is widely adopted nowadays and some blockchains even use a combination of both PoW and PoS. And in 2018, the Sunny King team release VEE zblockchain database cloud with high performance and high scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Peercoin is the first currency to protect the blockchain with Proof-of-Stake (PoS), as opposed to Proof-of-Work (PoW) adopted by Bitcoin. PoS mechanisms consume less energy for mining. Nowadays, PoS mechanism has a tendency to be widely adopted, like Ethereum, it will transition into a proof-of-stake model called Casper PoS. And EOS also runs on PoS mechanism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Primecoin is another attempt by Sunny King to avoid the energy waste of PoW. Because PoW does provide a consensus mechanism with the highest level of robustness in the current mainstream consensus mechanism. But how to maintain this kind of robustness and use energy in a meaningful way? Sunny King found a solution: looking for prime numbers. It still uses a PoW mechanism and is looking for prime numbers in the process. So far, Primecoin is the first and only cryptocurrency to make calculations for mining valuable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sunny King believes that the loss of energy will be the biggest challenge that Bitcoin will face when it comes to widespread use. Peercoin implements the proof of stake and proof of work system, while Primecoin implements proof-of-work and shares most of its source code and technology implementation. The design is based on a new concept of energy sustainability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beside to engage in the invention of cryptocurrency and technological innovation, Sunny King is also committed to maintaining a stable, fair and free virtual money market. Sunny King said that he embraces the free market principle. It can also be said that he is libertarian but does not advocate direct opposition to the government. In addition, he thinks that the virtual currency also needs some moral considerations. People like to have multiple choices. The biggest challenge would be the ways to get into the public’s field of vision when a new virtual currency and community appear. Sunny King emphasized “Conscience:” This is a free market but in order to win this free war, we should also look at ourselves in the mirror.

                        The Primecoin Foundation is established and led by the creator of Primecoin, Sunny King. It supports and promotes the evolving Primecoin protocol and its community, engages in cutting-edge base layer research to preserve the legacy of Useful Proof-of-Work Consensus that Primecoin introduced, and establishes an easily accessible ecosystem that realizes the future of decentralization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The lack of a core development team and official support has prevented Primecoin from becoming one of the most active and used crypto-currency, although many believe it to be one of the most practical blockchain technology. Primecoin is a top performing base level chain based on which to build more functionalities, with the fastest Proof-of-Work consensus-based transaction capacity and well-built minting and burning system. However, many supporters and the original team believes that Primecoin is far from realizing its full potential, therefore established the Primecoin foundation in 2018. The mission of the foundation is to "support and promote the evolving Primecoin protocol and its community, engage in cutting-edge base layer research to preserve the legacy of Useful Proof-of Work Consensus that Primecoin introduced, and establishes an easily accessible ecosystem that realizes the future of decentralization."

                        Primecoin was first conceived by Sunny King in 2012 and was released in 2013.
                        <br>In 2012, the energy consumption and waste problem of crypto-currency have not become a major environmental concern and subject to as much debate as it is today. However, Sunny King foresaw the problem in 2012. Out of technical efficiency and environmental considerations, he decided to create a completely new base level consensus. It must match the security level of SHA256 based hash-cash proof of work mechanism, while leveraging the network’s computing power to conduct useful scientific computing. With these goals in mind, Primecoin was created.
                        <br><br>Primecoin has the following unique and powerful features:
                    <h3>1. Speed</h3>
                    <p>
                        Proof of Work is still considered as the most robust consensus available. However, such a mechanism is usually slow due to the large amount of computation required.
                        <br>Primecoin offers the fastest transaction speed among proof of work based crypto-currencies, clocking as high as 70 TPS since its release and a 30 second expected confirmation time, 10 times that of Bitcoin, 8 times that of Ethereum and 4 times that of Litecoin. Possessing a fast native transaction speed support coupled with future development, Primecoin could be truly useful and be integrated with our daily life.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Legacy and Scientific Value</h3>
                    <p>
                        Primecoin is the first crypto-currency to adopt an Useful-Proof-of-Work (UPoW) consensus mechanism, leveraging all the network’s computing power to conduct scientific computing.
                        <br>The proof of work of Primecoin is based on a mathematical concept of prime chains. Problems such as the Riemann Hypothesis remains unsolved for almost 150100 years.
                        <br>Primecoin proof of work searches for large prime chains, fueling research that aims to tackle these problems.
                        <br>As Sunny King expressed in one of his interviews with LetsTalkBitcoin, he wanted his invention to inspire people to design more efficient algorithms to discover prime numbers and to prove that proof of work hashing power can be used for scientific computing. Indeed, his wishes came true. Volunteers designed and continue to optimize GPU mining algorithms for Primecoin that are hundreds of times more efficient than traditional prime number search, and Primecoin inspired other scientific computing crypto-currencies such as Gridcoin.
                        Not only does Primecoin offer what other blockchain technologies have to offer and more, it also propels human technology forward with a greener footprint, leaving a precious legacy for the future generations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Economy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Primecoin features an original economic system that provides a more stable and reliable equilibrium with a natural tendency to accumulate value over long-term usage.
                        <br>i.	Flexible Minting:
                        <br>The minting rate is flexible, in contrast with the conventional predetermined, mostly linear design. Minting of new Primecoin is inversely proportional to the square of the total hashing power. Coupled with instantaneous difficulty adjustments, this means a slight change in network hashing power will result in a major difference and therefore great resistance to stabilize mining equilibrium.
                        <br>ii.	Transaction Fee Burning:
                        <br>In the Primecoin framework, transaction fees are designed to be burned and become unspendable once used. Approximately 40% of maximum transaction capacity will saturate the production and lead Primecoin into a deflationary state, further increasing its scarcity. This mechanism will not affect the sender or the receiver of the transaction, thus has no effect on the usage of Primecoin. In one sentence, the more you use Primecoin, the more valuable it becomes.
                        <br>iii.	Natural scarcity:
                        <br>Unlike conventional crypto-currencies, where both the difficulty and mining are artificially designed, where coins are awarded to solve artificial puzzles such as finding a SHA256 hash. Primecoin is derived from nature. By finding naturally rare prime chains, Primecoin resembles traditional value vehicles such as gold and silver.
                        <br><br>Compared to conventional economics system of crypto-currencies, Primecoin incorporates two unique features that contribute to its intricate economy. The burning of transaction fees will increase the value of Primecoin the more transactions are processed, which in
